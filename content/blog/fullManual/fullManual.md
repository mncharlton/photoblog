Some more photos I took this week! (w/c 13th April)


#### Aperture of 3.5

| | Photo | Settings | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----|
| 1 | ![photo1](./images/DSC_0550.JPG) | Aperture Mode, f5.6 1/15 200 | |
| 2 | ![photo2](./images/DSC_0551.JPG) | Manual, f5.6 1/15 200 | Same as 1, but taken on manual |
| 3 | ![photo3](./images/DSC_0552.JPG) | Manual, f4 1/15 200 | Aperture moved 1 stop, photo over exposed |
| 4 | ![photo4](./images/DSC_0554.JPG) | Manual, f4 1/30 200 | Same exposure as 1, slightly shallower depth of field. Aperture and shutter speed both moved 1 stop |
| 5 | ![photo5](./images/DSC_0556.JPG) | Aperture Mode, f4 1/20 200 | |
| 6 | ![photo6](./images/DSC_0557.JPG) | Aperture Mode, f16 1/20 200 | Aperture moved 4 stops. Photo underexposed. |
| 7 | ![photo7](./images/DSC_0559.JPG) | Aperture Mode, f16 1/1.3 200 | Shutter speed moved to account for aperture change. Same exposure as 5. Wider depth of field |


### My notes
  - Each of the three settings moves in full stops, and either 1/2 stops or 1/3 stops.
  - My camera is set to 1/3 stops.
  - A stop in any of the settings is equivalent to a stop in any of the others.

### Stops

| | ISO | Aperture | Shutter Speed |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| | Less noise | More depth of field | More motion blur |
| Less Light | 100 | f22 | 1/30
| | 200 | f16 | 1/60
| | 400 | f11 | 1/125
| | 800 | f8 | 1/250
| | 1600 | f5.6 | 1/500
| | 3200 | f4 | 1/1000
| More Light | 6400 | | 1/2000
| | More noise | Less depth of field (blurry background) | Less motion blur |
