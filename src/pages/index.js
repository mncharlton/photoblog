          I'm currently learning photography following the fantastic (and free!)
          <a href='https://ayearwithmycamera.com/'> A Year With My Camera </a>
          course and I'll be using this blog to make notes as I go, as well as
          posting my a selection of my photos, hopefully there'll be a
          noticeable improvement as I learn!
